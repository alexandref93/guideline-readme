# Guideline Readme

Project inspired by a [StackOverflow response](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme)!

README should be simple and short, but a good README can save time especially if it's for something like command-line parameter parsing library.

## Topics

- Name of the projects and all sub-modules and libraries (sometimes they are named different and very confusing to new users).
- Descriptions of all the project, and all sub-modules and libraries.
- 5-line code snippet on how its used (if it's a library).
- Copyright and licensing information.
- Instructions to install, configure, and to run the programs.
- Other contact info (email address, website, company name, address, etc).
- A brief history if it's a replacement or a fork of something else.
- Legal notices (crypto stuff).
